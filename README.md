# fluent-ts-validator

A small validation library written in TypeScript which uses a fluent API and lambda expressions to build validation rules. It is inspired by the [FluentValidation](https://github.com/JeremySkinner/FluentValidation) library for .NET written by Jeremy Skinner.

Instead of implementing an awful lot of validation logic within this project again this library makes use of the mature validation library [validator.js](https://github.com/chriso/validator.js) and delegates most of its invocations to it.

In this respect, special thanks go to these two projects.
